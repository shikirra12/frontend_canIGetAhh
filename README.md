Can I Get Ahh

#Description
Can I Get Ahh was created on connect my past job as a bartender to my future career in software engineering. In this project, I created an API in Java to allow the function of the application to work properly. I also connected a third party API, Drink API, to funnel in the drinks, pictures, and ingredients. This app allows customers to look through the drink menu, add drinks to a cart, and send off their orders to a bartender. A bartender is able to receive the drink order, and inform customer of the process of their drink through notifications.

#Roadmap
I would like to incorporate payment processing and identification scanning. Also, I would need to first create a mobile version on the application.

#Contributing
I am open to contributions and would love to hear feedback about my application.

#Project status
My project is currently being worked on. A good portion of the back end is finished. Currently, I am working on the front end of the project.
